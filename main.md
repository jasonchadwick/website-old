I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in physics and minoring in computer science. My interests include applied physics, fusion energy, quantum computing, video game design, reading, taking care of my plants, and playing guitar.

### Projects

*Click a project name to read more*

[**chronodrifter**](/pages/chronodrifter.md): a 2D puzzle game where the player can change the direction of time. I am hoping to publish it as a standalone game sometime in the future and potentially make a 3D version afterwards. A live WebGL version of the game is hosted at [jasonchadwick.github.io/chronodrifter](https://jasonchadwick.github.io/chronodrifter).

[**quops**](/pages/quops.md): a checkers-like board game inspired by quantum computing, where moves consist of applying quantum logic gates to adjacent tiles. Currently not released anywhere, but I plan to in the future after polishing it more.

[**quantum optimal control**](/pages/pulses.md) (summer 2021 - present): Found optimal control pulses for transmon quantum computers, focusing on qudit operations. These pulses determine how much time it takes to apply certain quantum logic gates. I found pulses that allow for high-radix gate times significantly faster than theoretically expected, opening the door to new qudit-based optimizations to quantum circuits.

[**neural network for fusion plasma prediction**](/pages/fusion.md) (summer 2020 research): created a neural network using TensorFlow that can reliably predict fusion plasma density and pressure using only real-time-accessible measurements, for use in control systems. This approach is orders of magnitude faster than existing physics-based simulation code while maintaining high accuracy.

[**cosmic string research**](/pages/cosmic-strings.md) (summer 2019 research): simulated the time evolution and gravitational wave emissions of cosmic strings. Cosmic strings are proposed creases in spacetime that are leftovers from the expansion of the universe.

I have worked on personal and academic projects in:

- **Julia**: [optimal pulse control](/pages/pulses.md).
- **Python**: [fusion neural network](/pages/fusion.md), [quops game](/pages/quops.md).
- **Unity/C#**: [chronodrifter game](/pages/chronodrifter.md), quops - graphical edition *(coming soon)*.
- **Common Lisp**: [cosmic strings](/pages/cosmic-strings.md).
- **C**: various projects for Computer Systems course, including an implementation of malloc, a unix shell, and a web proxy.

And various others such as SML, Bash, and Mathematica.
