I am currently pursuing a computer science Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, studying quantum computer architecture. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022 with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. My interests within quantum computing include multi-valued logic, optimal control and compilation. My other interests include video game design, biking, and playing guitar.

#### Academic

[**quantum optimal control**](/pages/pulses.md) (summer 2021 - present): Found optimal control pulses for transmon quantum computers, focusing on qudit operations. These pulses determine how much time it takes to apply certain quantum logic gates. I found pulses that allow for high-radix gate times significantly faster than theoretically expected, opening the door to new qudit-based optimizations to quantum circuits.

[**neural network for fusion plasma prediction**](/pages/fusion.md) (summer 2020 research): created a neural network using TensorFlow that can reliably predict fusion plasma density and pressure using only real-time-accessible measurements, for use in control systems. This approach is orders of magnitude faster than existing physics-based simulation code while maintaining high accuracy.

[**cosmic string research**](/pages/cosmic-strings.md) (summer 2019 research): simulated the time evolution and gravitational wave emissions of cosmic strings. Cosmic strings are proposed creases in spacetime that are leftovers from the expansion of the universe.

#### Personal projects

[**chronodrifter**](/pages/chronodrifter.md): a 2D puzzle game where the player can change the direction of time. I am hoping to publish it as a standalone game sometime in the future and potentially make a 3D version afterwards. A live WebGL version of the game is hosted at <a href="https://placeholder-studios-dev.github.io/chronodrifter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">placeholder-studios-dev.github.io/chronodrifter</a>.

[**quops**](/pages/quops.md): a checkers-like board game inspired by quantum computing, where moves consist of applying quantum logic gates to adjacent tiles. Currently not released anywhere, but I am thinking about it in the future after polishing it more.
