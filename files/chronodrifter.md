Chronodrifter is a 2D puzzle platformer based around the idea of time reversal. The player can slow down and reverse the time of their environment without affecting their own timeline, which allows for cool tricks like below:

I began the project in the summer of 2021 and resumed working on it that winter after the semester ended, along with a few friends. We plan to release the game once we develop it further, and potentially create a 3D version in the future.
