I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in physics and minoring in computer science. My interests include applied physics, fusion energy, quantum computing, video game design, reading, taking care of my plants, and playing guitar.

### Projects

*Click the project names for longer descriptions*

[**chronodrifter**](/pages/chronodrifter.md): a 2D puzzle game where the player can change the direction of time. I am hoping to publish it as a standalone game sometime in the future, and potentially make a 3D version afterwards. Live WebGL game at [jasonchadwick.github.io/chronodrifter](https://jasonchadwick.github.io/chronodrifter).

[**quops**](/pages/quops.md): a checkers-like board game inspired by quantum computing, where moves consist of applying quantum logic gates to adjacent tiles. 

[**optimal pulse control**](/pages/pulses.md) (summer 2021 - present): Found optimal control pulses for transmon quantum computers, focusing on qudit operations. Control pulses determine the duration of quantum logic gates. I found high-radix pulses that allow for gate times significantly faster than theoretically expected, opening the door to new qudit-based optimizations to quantum circuits.

[**neural network for fusion plasma prediction**](/pages/fusion.md) (summer 2020 research): I created a neural network with TensorFlow that can reliably predict fusion plasma density and pressure using only real-time-accessible measurements, for use in control systems. Orders of magnitude faster than existing physics-based simulation code while maintaining high accuracy.

[**cosmic string research**](/pages/cosmic-strings.md) (summer 2019 research): I simulated the time evolution and gravitational wave emissions of cosmic strings, which are proposed creases in spacetime that are leftovers from the expansion of the universe. I also worked on a mathematical proof regarding the stability of a class of cosmic string loops.
