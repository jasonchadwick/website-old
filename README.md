I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in physics and minoring in computer science. My interests include applied physics, fusion energy, quantum computing, video game design, reading, taking care of my plants, and playing guitar.

### Projects

[**chronodrifter**](/files/chronodrifter.md): a 2D puzzle game where the player can change the direction of time. I am hoping to publish it as a standalone game sometime in the future, and potentially make a 3D version afterwards. Live WebGL game at [jasonchadwick.github.io/chronodrifter](https://jasonchadwick.github.io/chronodrifter).

[**quops**](/files/quops.md): a checkers-like board game inspired by quantum computing, where moves consist of applying quantum logic gates to adjacent tiles. 

[**optimal pulse control**](/files/pulses.md) (summer 2021 - present): used the `Juqbox.jl` package to find optimal control pulses for transmon quantum computers, focusing on qudit operations. Found pulses allowing for gate times significantly faster than theoretically expected, opening the door to new qudit-based optimizations to quantum circuits.

[**fusion plasma prediction neural network**](/files/fusion.md) (summer 2020 research): created a neural network using TensorFlow that can reliably predict fusion plasma density and pressure using only real-time-accessible measurements, for use in control systems. Orders of magnitude faster than existing physics-based simulation code, while maintaining high accuracy.

[**cosmic string research**](/files/cosmicstrings.md) (summer 2019 research): simulated the time evolution and gravitational wave emissions of cosmic strings, proposed creases in spacetime that are leftovers from the expansion of the universe.

### Programming Languages

I have worked on personal and academic projects in:

- **Julia**: [optimal pulse control](/files/pulses.md).
- **Unity/C#**: [chronodrifter](/files/chronodrifter.md), *(coming soon)* quops - graphical edition.
- **Python**: [quops](/files/quops.md), [reddit-stocks](/files/stocks.md).
- **C**: various projects for Computer Systems course, including an implementation of `malloc`, a unix shell, and a web proxy.
- **Common Lisp**: [cosmic strings](/files/cosmicstrings.md).

And various others such as SML, Bash, and Mathematica.
